## Problem Statement

In the context of the final project, the challenge is to apply transfer learning techniques to train a classifier for a complex dataset that combines the Stanford Cars, Food101, Flowers, and FGVC Aircraft datasets. The objective is to achieve accurate classification for a subset of 100 classes, each containing 10 training images. The datasets present varying characteristics, such as different image dimensions and levels of noise.

To address this task, participants are required to:

Utilize transfer learning by loading pre-trained model weights and fine-tune them on the provided dataset.
Implement advanced architectures and employ sophisticated data augmentations for improved performance.
Resize all images to a consistent size (e.g., 224x224) before training.
Ensure reproducibility by using a manual seed, repeating experiments, and reporting averaged training and validation accuracies/losses.
Provide detailed instructions, code, and model weights on Canvas for reproducibility.
The complexity lies in effectively adapting and fine-tuning pre-trained models to achieve high accuracy on a challenging dataset with limited samples. Participants must balance the use of modern, computationally intensive models with the dataset's relatively small size to prevent overfitting.
